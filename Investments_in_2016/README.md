Write an SQL query to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

- have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
- are not located in the same city like any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).

Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.
